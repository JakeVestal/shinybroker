## "Somewhat Interactive" Development Mode

As you're developing apps, it's sometimes useful to just create a scratch file
containing a bit of code that grabs some input. You can watch the information
get printed by the async reader loop as it becomes available off the socket, and
 maybe copy-paste it from the terminal printout do perform some of your
exploratory development work.

#### Simple exploratory example:
```{python}
#| eval: false
{{< include examples/headless_mode_1.py >}}
```
